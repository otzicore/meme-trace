# 🛡️ MemeTrace – Defend Your Feed

**An open-source toolkit to trace the origin, manipulation, and intent behind viral memes and disinformation.**

---

## ❓ Why This Exists

In the age of algorithmic chaos, memes aren't just jokes — they're **weapons**. Foreign troll farms, botnets, and ideological operators use them to:

- Exploit our divisions  
- Distort narratives  
- Inflame distrust  

What starts as a laugh can end as real-world violence, broken trust, or civic paralysis.

**MemeTrace is a digital immune system.** It's not here to censor or judge — it's here to **expose where things come from**, **who's pushing them**, and **how coordinated they are**.

---

## 🧠 What It Does (Eventually)

### ✅ Meme Origin Tracing
- Detects recycled, AI-generated, or coordinated meme formats  
- Matches image hashes, OCR content, and metadata across public datasets  

### ✅ Timeline & Botnet Awareness
- Maps how fast a meme spreads and who amplified it first  
- Flags coordinated swarm behavior and known disinfo vectors  

### ✅ Lightweight Browser Companion
- Non-intrusive icon overlay  
- Click to get “context card” with origin, timeline, and first-seen info  
- Optional deep dive for power users and OSINT analysts

## 🚫 What It Doesn’t Do

- Censor memes  
- Judge “truth”  
- Push partisan narratives  

We're here for **transparency**, not control.

---

## 🔓 Open, Transparent, Accountable

MemeTrace will always be:

- 🧩 Open source and community-run  
- 👥 Nonpartisan and contributor-diverse  
- 🔍 Transparent in how it flags and traces  
- 🧠 Designed for critical thinkers, not fragile minds  

We’re building it like **Signal** or **uBlock Origin**, not like a platform moderation bot.

## 🧭 Roadmap (V0.1)

- [ ] Image hash + text OCR detection module  
- [ ] Simple meme provenance tracker (first seen, repost count, velocity)  
- [ ] Minimal browser extension with hover tooltips  
- [ ] Public dashboard showing viral meme waves  
- [ ] Contributor governance doc + code of conduct

## 🤝 Who We Need

- Developers (JS/TS, Python, Rust, browser extensions)  
- OSINT nerds (Bellingcat-style researchers)  
- UI/UX folks (lightweight, non-intrusive design)  
- Civic technologists and educators  
- People like you, who are tired of watching society get hijacked by anonymous PNGs

## ✊ Join the Digital Minutemen

You don’t need to be a coder to contribute. If you believe in digital sovereignty, free speech *with clarity*, and tools that empower citizens, join us.

This is how we fight back. Not with censorship. Not with rage.

With **light**.
